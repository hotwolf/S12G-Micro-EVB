title: RevB Boards Have Arrived
---

My order of RevB boards has arrived yesterday. I had ordered the boards from "Seeedstudio":http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/Services-c-70_71/.

In my Eagle layout I had just placed a some of the new solder pads on top of my silkscreen lables. I figured that there wouldn't be enogh room for propper labeling anyway. But Seeedstudio/Fusion actually went through the work of rearranging my lables, so that they would be still visible. What a nice service.
