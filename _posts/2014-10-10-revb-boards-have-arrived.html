title: RevB Boards Have Arrived
---

<p>My order of RevB boards has arrived yesterday. I had ordered the boards from <a href="//www.seeedstudio.com/depot/Services-c-70_71/">Seeedstudio</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/RevB-Boards.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>In my Eagle layout I had just placed a some of the new solder pads on top of my silkscreen lables. I figured that there wouldn&#8217;t be enogh room for propper labeling anyway. But Seeedstudio/Fusion actually went through the work of rearranging my lables, so that they would be still visible. What a nice service.</p>
