title: RevB Boards Designed and Ordered

Recently a FT232RL broke on one of my S12G-Micro-EVBs. I don't know exactly what went wrong, but I assume it broke because it was powered through the RXD pin for a longer time period while the USB supply was disconnected. This whole mishap revealed some shortcomings in my board design, which are now addressed in a new revision of the EVB:

* Inserted resistors (R9,R10,R11,R12) in between the S12G and the FT232RL to reduce the current injection of either side of the interface.
* Added voltage divider (R13,R14) to drive the FT232RL's reset input low, in case the USB supply is disconnected.
* Added solder jumper (J3) to feed the divided USB supply to PAD7
* Enhanced FT232RL's supply options (J1,J4)
* Moved all ICs to the same side of the board, so they can be accessed even if the S12G-Micro-EVB is mounted onto another application board.
* The USB connector is now located on the opposite side, which better fits better into the "AriCalculator":http://hotwolf.github.com/AriCalculator.
* Placed LED's series resistors (R1,R7,R8) on the opposite side of the PCB. Now LEDs can be mounted on either side of the board by swapping them with their resistors.

RevB boards are expected to arrive in October.
